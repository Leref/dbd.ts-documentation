## Creating a simple function example 

To begin creating a function example, we would be using `.md` aka Markdowns.

### Example

```
---
description: The function / callback / etc description.
---

# INSERT NAME
### Usage
```php
INSERT NAME


### Example
```js
bot.commands.add({
  type: "basicCommand",
  name: "INSERT NAME",
  code: `INSERT CODE`
})
```
- `INSERT NAME` would be the example name 
- `name` property may or not be used for certain things
- You would need to provide inside of `code` field how this example works. (Must be specific)
